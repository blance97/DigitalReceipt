# DigitalReceipt
Digital receipt tracking app. This is one of my first react applications that I have built. For the front-end a combination of react-semantic ui and bootstrap was utilized. It uses redux to control the flow of data. Node.js (Express)/Mysql was used in backend.

## Purpose
 To allow for a user to conveniently manage their products online. This will also send an email to a customer(given the customers email).  
 This application has very useful displaying tools such as graphical data and table data.

## TODO:
 * Mobile app for receipt signing.
